# Karuta Self Accont Bot for Card collection and Event Items 

This Does not uses Card detection  method, Instead it done by using Bot's like kalender which sends a replay message for karuta message - if a good card drops with the number emoji on it

  
WE use Spam accs to make Karuta drop cards.. and task function for user id to drop every 30 mins 
We Use Bot Acc to read the message sent by Kalender (detecter bot)  and fetch the Karuta message Id with the good one and react some thing on it.. <br>
As User ot Acc's can read the on_reaction method it reacts the specified number emoji to the Karuta's Message which results in card collection

Karuta Host : <br>
1 st karuta card - 50ms <br>
2 th  - 100 ms <br>
3 th - 150 ms <br>
4 th - 200 ms <br>

Set proper delay depending on ur Host
