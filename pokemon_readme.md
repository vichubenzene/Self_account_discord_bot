# For pokemon grinder 

This Pokemon auto catcher can be used only if the the pokemon bot doesn't use slash commands for catching.. which may make this autocather bot unusable after April 2022.. where the discord bot privacy policy changes the verified bots to use onlyslash commandss for communication


to use this bot run the file <a href="https://github.com/vichubenzene/Self_account_discord_bot/blob/main/pokemon_grinder/user%20account.py">User accounnt.py</a>.. and <a href="https://github.com/vichubenzene/Self_account_discord_bot/tree/main/pokemon_grinder/pokemon">Bot account</a> in other environment


alogorithm :
I used a user account and a bot account because user accounts cant read the message.content

So the bot account gets the image and using cv2 lib it finds the pokemon name.. for communication between the user and bot accs.. the bot creates the textable channel and send a random message with the name of the pokemon.. As the user bots acc can get the name of the channel.. the name of the pokemon will be recieved by the user acc as the name of the channel. then it send's the recieved data in the spawn channel


I used 2 user accunts duel aginst each other.. which grinds 10 crds per battle, which made a avrg of 30,000 credits per day.. i didn't add the code here cuz they replaced emoji to buttons.. where buttons are ment for human press..
 
hmmm... it took me a time to figure out this communication between user acc and bot acc.. it runs like as it was fixed with a 5 bucks sticky paste.. but it is effective it made my 3 accounts reach top table on the leaderboard of pokemon bot (ID:669228505128501258) with 1.5 million pokemons per account.. still grinding more till the slash commands gets into action..
i lost intrest in this feild now.. i stoped trying to make it for work for slash commands and buttons
